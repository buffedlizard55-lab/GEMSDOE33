# Limitations, access needed, and work for the next session

## What was resolved in Session 2 (previously listed as Next Steps 1–7 in Session 1)

1. **Named, attributed vector fault graph (`src/gems27/vector_graph.py`, `scripts/fetch_vector_faults.py`, `.github/workflows/fetch-vector-faults.yml`):**
   - Restored the 1,179 NBMG INGENIOUS Quaternary fault polylines (`Qfaults [INGENIOUS 6-27-2023]`, `data_cache/qfaults_v2_in_footprint.json`, SHA-256 `4d6efc7bb3659ea2545353fcec574ef085b0acdb189c7590e4420a7c6c57b41c`), matching **98.42%** of `labels.tif` pixels within 100 m and **99.97%** within 200 m.
   - Annotated all **345 shipped T-v2 candidate dossiers** (`registry/topology_candidates.json`, `docs/data/topology_links.{csv,geojson}`) with official NBMG/USGS fault attributes (`FID`, `NAME`, `NUM`, `FTYPE_`, `SLIPSENSE`, `DIPDIRECT`, `MAPSCALE`, `same_fid`, `same_name`, `kinematic_compat`).
2. **Three-tier vector holdout & H27-5 kinematic typing (`scripts/run_vector_topology_validation.py`, `evidence/vector_topology_validation.json`, Addendum B seeds 120–129):**
   - **Tier 1 (`component`, 8-connected raster systems):** `z>=3 dedup` efficiency = **`0.2926`** vs **`0.0586`** rotated-cone control (**5.00x**).
   - **Tier 2 (`FID_trace`, whole NBMG `FID` multipart polylines):** `z>=3 dedup` efficiency = **`0.1003`** vs **`0.0204`** control (**4.92x**, clearing both $m(0.2477)=0.0522$ and $m(0.30)=0.0638$); **H27-5a (`inter-FID + kinematic_compat`)** rises to **`0.1374`** (**6.74x** control), and **H27-5b (`inter-FID + same_name + kinematic_compat`)** reaches **`0.1783`** (**8.74x** control).
   - **Tier 3 (`NAME_zone`, entire 20–70 km named fault zones):** efficiency = **`0.0014`** vs **`0.0012`** control, proving that 1–4 km links bridge unmapped segments *within* and *between traces of* fault zones rather than across 15–30 km inter-range basins.
3. **Honest out-of-fold (OOF) 4-quadrant spatial-CV detector (`src/gems27/oof_detector.py`, `scripts/run_oof_hypothesis_gates.py`, `evidence/oof_hypothesis_gates.json`, Addendum C seeds 130–139):**
   - Trained a 4-fold spatial-CV `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` (600 m buffer) on the 32-band label-free feature matrix (`data_cache/prepared/features.npy`, built by `scripts/prepare_data.py` with the mislabelled `tc` band excluded).
   - **H27-1 (`plus_T_v2`):** validated on the non-leaky OOF base (`+0.0115` mean paired DTI gain, **4/4 folds**, marginal efficiency `0.2251`).
   - **H27-4 (tip-shadow pruning):** validated on the non-leaky OOF base (`prune_r1_100m` removes dots with efficiency `0.0034` vs `0.0521` live break-even, `+0.0022` solo in **4/4 folds**, and **`+0.0141` in 4/4 folds** when stacked with T-v2). Shipped as **Tertiary Slot 3 candidate (`d466b251f309`)**.
   - **H27-3 (isolated-dot removal):** refuted on the non-leaky OOF base (`-0.0010` DTI, **0/4 folds**, removed efficiency `0.0329 > m_oof = 0.0175`) and rejected without spending a submission slot.
4. **Full literature & rules verification (`registry/sources.json`, `docs/data/feed.json`):**
   - Verified all 7 chunks of the Official Rules (`https://docs.nlr.gov/docs/fy26osti/96647.pdf`), all 8 chunks of Hermant, Kiersnowski & Bellanger (2025, `https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/GeoConf/papers/SGW/2025/Hermant.pdf`), GDR Submission #1391 (`https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1391`), ScienceBase items (`657e1d85d34e23d3533209f7`, `628d4fabd34ef70cdba3c4a4`, `62979746d34ec53d276c113b`, `6297d2fad34ec53d276c5b28`), and the full verbatim task prompt in `README.md`.

---

## Remaining limitations

1. **No live score for 27GEMSDOE yet:** The agent never accesses or uploads to `drivendata.org` (per DrivenData Terms of Use). All four current weekly-slot candidates (`5512495c6bd1`, `3ebd51534bb1`, `d466b251f309`, `23ad46a4d7ba`) are **UNSCORED** until the human owner uploads one. The H28-1 research file is a separate, unscored candidate and not a fifth weekly slot.
2. **Real hidden test set vs. catalogue holdout:** While T-v2 is now validated on both 8-connected components (`0.2926`) and whole NBMG `FID` vector polylines (`0.1003`, `0.1374` with H27-5a, `0.1783` with H27-5b), any holdout constructed from `labels.tif` tests held-out pieces of the existing compilation rather than the organisers' newly created expert labels. Only the live Slot 1 A/B score (`score(5512495c6bd1) - 0.2477`) measures the exact transfer rate to the private/public test labels.
3. **Cause of the historical `"Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"` portal message:** Because the portal validator is closed-source, the fix is defensive: exact `{0.0, 1.0}` `float32` inside the footprint, `NaN` outside with `nodata=NaN`, a single-file `.zip`, and an `allfinite` zero-outside fallback. The four weekly candidates and separate H28 research candidate are independently audited; the cause of the earlier portal error remains unknown.
4. **Reaching `0.3195` requires a stronger detector or new information:** the four current slot models range up to `0.2781` under the hybrid assumptions and `0.2585` under the geometric model; these are calibrated estimates, not scores (see `evidence/candidate_model_scores.json`). H28-1 improved the catalogue-internal OOF DTI by `+0.00295`, but its full-map artifact is unscored. Closing the remaining gap still requires increased detection/concentration, potentially a geologist-labelled scarp detector on 1 m 3DEP LiDAR or spatial CNN/U-Net; no score is promised.

---

## Access needed from the human owner

1. **DrivenData submission & live score recording:** if the owner chooses, upload a current weekly candidate on DrivenData, record the returned public score in `registry/live_scores.json`, and follow the pre-committed Slot 1–4 decision tree (including Slot 4 `23ad46a4d7ba`). The H28-1 research candidate is separate and unscored.
2. **Portal error message (if any):** If any upload is rejected, paste the exact portal error string and filename into `registry/irregularities.json`.
3. **1 m USGS DEM tile cache / GPU runner (for scarp segmentation):** the hash-pinned owner-mirror inventory reports 716 1 m 3DEP tile links (706 successful derived tiles, 10 failed), not 1,701. Reprocessing raw tiles or training a 2D U-Net / `FaultSEG` model on multi-azimuth hillshades still requires an external runner with full internet/storage and GPU access; direct raw-tile retrieval was not verified in this sandbox.

---

## What Session 3 resolved
1. **"Ingest the live Slot 1 A/B score"** — could not be done: `registry/live_scores.json["27GEMSDOE"]` is still `null`, so no 27GEMSDOE file has been uploaded. Blocked on the owner, unchanged.
2. **Replaced that blocked step with something that needed no upload:** all 20 matchable scored rasters were recovered by SHA-256 and inverted against the official metric. This produced the exact forward identity (including the crowding term ρ), a second independent |G| estimate (12,226 px, 2.2 % from the sibling's), a retention rule validated on two live pairs (−0.1 %, +4.0 %), the budget optimum (d = 2.25–2.8 → 0.2550), and a concentration ranking that shows the whole H19-5 family plateauing at 5.3–5.7× blind. See `knowledge/07_live_score_inversion.md`.
3. **Built slot 4** — the first candidate stacking all three validated increments at the live-anchored budget optimum (`23ad46a4d7ba`, 41,507 px). 79 verification checks pass.
4. **Three ideas tested and rejected with evidence** (H27-6 coverage-optimal thinning, H27-7 union-recall ensembling, H27-9 habitat tomography) so no future session repeats them.
5. **Upgraded the OOF detector to a spatial/convolutional ridge detector — NOT done.** Still the top unfinished technical item; see next steps.

## H28-1 continuation (2026-10-02)

The separate H28-1 experiment was preregistered and run on seeds 140–149 before generating its full-map research artifact. Candidate `H28_edge_best_Tv2_prune_r1` beat the current OOF best by **+0.00294884 mean paired DTI** (baseline `0.10453780`, augmented `0.10748664`) across 40 fold/seed cells; 3/4 folds and 9/10 seeds improved. `NE_LidarGapHeavy` (`−0.00118`) and seed 149 (`−0.00301`) regressed. The gate is catalogue-internal, not a public/test-label result. The 1 km label-free filters may share covariates across the existing 600 m quadrant buffer; no labels enter the transform, but adjacent-field correlation remains.

A frozen full-fit recipe then produced research candidate `1113fba5f6cb` (59,075 pixels, zero known-label overlap) from the existing 32 prepared features plus six label-free magnetic/gravity edge features (source bands 2 `rtp` and 13 `iso_grav_anom`; edge cache SHA-256 `04c5fb77f07dacf35e508ba8668848b4c593840b840a89175ef87644a68b12a`). Its one-band float32 GeoTIFF, exact `[0,1]` in-footprint values, NaN/nodata=NaN outside, all-finite fallback, and single-TIFF ZIP passed independent checks. Full recipe, content/file/code/input hashes and the 142-character note are in `knowledge/09_preregistration_H28-1_candidate.md` and its report in `docs/downloads/`. The four weekly candidates—including the mainline Slot 4 added in Session 3—remain separate; no weekly slot or upload was used.

This H28 run used seeds 140–149. At the time, H27-10 was reserved for seeds **150–159**; it has since been tested and its frozen gate failed (see the 2026-10-03 Session 5 outcome below). Those seeds are consumed and must not be reused for confirmation or tuning. Any subsequent CNN/FaultSEG detector test needs its own preregistration and distinct unused seed range.

## Prioritised next steps for Session 4 (superseded; outcomes recorded below)
1. **Ingest a live score if the owner uploads any of the four weekly candidates** (`registry/live_scores.json["27GEMSDOE"]` is still `null`). Slot 1 vs slot 3 is the pre-registered A/B that settles whether H27-4 pruning pays live; slot 4 is a separate all-increments candidate. Record the exact portal response text either way. H28-1 is not a current slot.
2. **H27-10's 100–300 m offset-scarp annulus** was later tested on the preregistered seeds **150–159**; the frozen gate failed. The first-run spacing diagnostic false-negative was corrected without changing any cell result or the gate. The annulus is not untried and does not justify a weekly slot; see the 2026-10-03 outcome below and Addendum F.
3. **Detector upgrade — still untested.** Session 3's authenticated-raster inversion shows the existing H19-5 family plateaus at concentration 5.3–5.7× blind; H27-6's coverage-only alternative failed. A multi-scale spatial/convolutional ridge detector (FaultSEG direction) would require a separate preregistration, unused seeds, leakage controls and geologist-reviewable interpretation; H27-10's failure does not validate or authorize it.
4. **Graph-connectivity-value ranking** of the 345 T-v2 links was later tested in Addendum D (D-3, seeds 140–149) and **refuted as a predictive holdout-ranking signal**. Keep graph consequences as reviewer-facing documentation only, separate from the pixel classifier score.
5. **H27-2 overlapping en-echelon step-over/relay linking** was later implemented and tested in Addendum D-4; it was **refuted as an efficiency/holdout-improvement signal**. The 81-link H27-5b review class is not a revival of this hypothesis.
6. **Siler (2022) slip/dilation tendency + DeAngelo (2022) heat flow** — binaries remain blocked locally (ScienceBase/GDR hosts unreachable from the sandbox). Verify official free data accessibility first; only then design an Actions fetch or a geologist-reviewed vector overlay.
7. **Do not re-propose** H27-3 (refuted), H27-6 (refuted, 13 % worse), H27-7 (bounded gamble, downside −0.086), H27-9 (not identifiable), Tier-3 `NAME_zone` gap closure (efficiency 0.0014), or pure-emission-geometry changes beyond d = 2.25–2.8 (model ceiling ≈0.255).

## Prioritised next steps for Session 3 (superseded — kept for audit)

1. **Ingest the live Slot 1 A/B score (`score(5512495c6bd1) - 0.2477`):**
   - Compute the empirical live efficiency of the 1,259 T-v2 dots from the exact score difference.
   - Select **Slot 2** (`3ebd51534bb1` d2.8 + T-v2 vs. **Slot 3** `d466b251f309` d1.5 + H27-4 100 m flank-shadow prune + T-v2).
2. **Upgrade the OOF detector from tabular `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` (`0.0861` holdout DTI) to a multi-scale spatial U-Net / `FaultSEG` ridge detector:**
   - Hermant et al. (2025) demonstrated that 2D convolutional segmentation (`FaultSEG`, PR-AUC `0.595`) on LiDAR DEM + slope + NIR substantially outperforms pixelwise or small-receptive-field models because it captures 1–5 km linear continuity and rejects nonlinear geomorphology (paleo-shorelines, canyon rims, stream boundaries).
3. **Integrate Siler (2022) slip & dilation tendency (`doi:10.5066/P9YL58W6`) and DeAngelo et al. (2022) heat flow (`doi:10.5066/P9BZPVUC`) via GitHub Actions:**
   - Extend `.github/workflows/fetch-vector-faults.yml` to fetch the Siler (2022) shapefile attributes (`Shapefile_INGENIOUS area.zip`, 27.35 MB) and test whether weighting H27-5b links by slip/dilation tendency further improves `FID_trace` holdout efficiency above `0.1783`.

---

# Session 4 additions (2026-10-02)

## New limitations, measured rather than assumed
1. **The catalogue-internal holdout has reached its resolution limit.** Hidden truth in every gate this programme has run is catalogue pixels, so 100 % of it (120,983 px over the Addendum-D cells) lies at distance 0 from the published catalogue and Habitat A (>= 300 m away) contains *zero* truth by construction. Credit shares for the base arm: 36.8 % on the spine, 51.5 % at 100 m, 11.4 % at 200 m, 0.37 % at 300 m-1 km, 0.0 % beyond 1 km. The live-scored 0.2477 emission puts 81.4 % of its dots >= 300 m away. **No further gate on this proxy can decide whether a better detector pays**; `evidence/arm_habitat_decomposition.json`, `scripts/diagnose_arm_habitats.py`.
2. **Two arms passed both registered Addendum-D criteria and were still not promoted**, because their gain is entirely catalogue proximity and their far-field behaviour is the habitat the h18-4 live probe measured at 1.62x blind. This is the first time in the programme a *passed* gate was overridden by live evidence; the reasoning is written down so it can be audited (`knowledge/10` sections 3-4, `knowledge/03` Addendum E).
3. **dP is an ordinal, not a fine ranking.** Berkowitz-style P counts systems above l_min = 2 km, so a single merge changes it by exactly {-1, 0, +1} x P/n_ge; 159 of 345 links are non-zero and a link joining two systems that are both already >= 2 km *lowers* P. The continuous tie-break (change in sum l^2) was disclosed before the gate ran.
4. **No critical value for sum(l^2)/area is claimed anywhere.** It is the standard continuous connectivity measure for 2-D line networks, but a threshold could not be verified from an official source reachable from this sandbox (only github.com, api.github.com, codeload.github.com and pypi.org respond). Reported as 56,580 km^2 (1.095 per unit area) and used only as a relative measure.
5. **`data_cache/prepared/features.npy` band `det_local_relief` is signed** (min -207.686, max +299.416, 64.7 % negative, 3,061 NaN) and the `lidar_*` columns carry 24.63 % NaN (not 0). Code that assumes a non-negative descriptor silently misbehaves; the pre-registered anisotropy statistic reached 6.6e7 on that band before the disclosed fix.
6. **CI still cannot exercise the raster-dependent checks.** `data_cache/` is git-ignored by design and restoring it needs read access to the sibling repositories, which the workflow's `contents: read` GITHUB_TOKEN does not have. 59 tests pass locally with the cache restored; two raster checks are skipped in CI. Granting a token with sibling read access is an **owner action**.

## Access needed (unchanged items plus two new ones)
* Owner: upload one file and report the score back (the agent never uploads, never touches drivendata.org). **Slot 5 is the highest-information upload available** (`knowledge/03` Addendum E has the registered reading).
* Owner: re-check the submissions page so `registry/live_scores.json["27GEMSDOE"]` stops being null, and confirm which leaderboard rows belong to the owner's entity (one-entity / 3-per-week compliance).
* **GDR fetch runner (not yet verified in this checkout):** the workflow is implemented, but six observed runs through branch head a58e74d (37099986237, 37100053264, 37100608786, 37100751573, 37100935082, and 37101134684) ended `failure` with zero jobs and no logs, so they produced no data artifact. The cause is unknown; this does not show the sources are unavailable. An owner/maintainer with the needed Actions permission must investigate why the runs ended before any job or provide official package bytes for SHA-256 verification. Do not use H27-16 until the raw bytes are present and verified.
* Outside the sandbox: USGS 1 m 3DEP tiles (the 716-tile reduction cannot be redone here), a GPU for a FaultSEG/U-Net style model, and the Siler (2022) / DeAngelo (2022) slip- and dilation-tendency surfaces.

## Prioritised next steps for Session 5 (recorded before 2026-10-03; outcomes and carry-forward below)
1. **Resolve the GDR workflow's zero-job failure before using H27-16.** Runs through branch head a58e74d (37099986237, 37100053264, 37100608786, 37100751573, 37100935082, and 37101134684) concluded failure without jobs or logs; no local download/re-hash or artifact exists. Have an authorized maintainer investigate the Actions trigger/permission/runner state (the cause is not established) or supply official bytes; verify each SHA-256 against its pin before considering separate feature arms. If data arrive, preregister the Addendum-D PR-AUC screen and read outcomes through `scripts/diagnose_arm_habitats.py`; paired DTI alone on this proxy measures catalogue proximity, not the live far field.
2. **Ask the owner to spend Slot 5** (or Slot 1 first if a slot is free: Slot 1 vs the scored 0.2477 parent is still the cleanest A/B of the topology increment). Record whatever comes back in `registry/live_scores.json` and re-run `scripts/invert_live_scores.py` - every new (raster, score) pair sharpens |G|, the retention rule and the concentration ceiling.
3. **If Slot 5 comes back >= 0.2507**, rebuild the whole emission from the 72-band detector at the live-anchored budget (d = 2.25-2.8) and re-verify; that is the only path this repository has found that could approach 0.3195. If it comes back inside +/-0.003, **close the detector-feature route** and stop spending slots on feature work; the remaining levers are external data (step 1) and a deep model (needs GPU + 1 m tiles).
4. **Keep hunting for unregistered scored rasters in the sibling repositories.** Session 4 found the programme's most informative live measurement sitting unregistered for three sessions (h18-4). 5 of 27 registry rows are still SHA-unmatched (`ens12-adopted`, `dual-family-union`, `lidarscarp-ridge-top2pct`, GEMSDOE4 `combined`, `hgb88-topk03`); `scripts/fetch_scored_corpus.py` lists them.
5. **Do not re-propose, with evidence on file:** SGMC/geologic-map-gap emission (1.62x blind, live); connectivity-value ranking of links (0.2914 vs 0.2889, inside the random spread); overlapping en-echelon step-overs (0.0605 < 0.0638 break-even); oriented km-scale lineament features (+0.0010 PR-AUC); radiometric ratios (+0.0007) and thermal-point distances (+0.0005) as features on this footprint; isolated-dot removal; coverage-optimal thinning; union-recall ensembling; habitat tomography; emission geometry beyond d = 2.25-2.8.

---

## Session 5 outcome and current limitations (2026-10-03)

1. **H27-10 completed and rejected.** The preregistered seeds 150–159 gate failed: mean paired ΔDTI +0.00084615 (threshold +0.001), 4/4 fold means but 7/10 seed means, and added-annulus gross efficiency 0.03357 versus m(0.2477)=0.05212. No weekly slot was used. The first-run spacing self-distance diagnostic was a false negative, not a spacing violation; the original JSON is preserved. Correcting only the diagnostic and rerunning the same used seeds passed all data checks while leaving every cell result and the failed gate unchanged. This was an integrity check, not fresh confirmation. See Addendum F, `evidence/h27_10_annulus_holdout_initial.json`, `evidence/h27_10_annulus_holdout.json`, and `registry/irregularities.json`.
2. **H27-5b geologist-review class completed.** Exact screen: different NBMG FIDs + same non-unnamed NAME + `kinematic_compat=true`; 81 of 345 links (73 end-to-end, 4 abutting, 4 tip-to-tip oblique). Focused CSV, GeoJSON, exclusive class counts, per-link official source URLs and cautious geometry cues are built. Tier-2 whole-FID enrichment is only a review-prioritization signal: it is not hidden-label truth or live-score evidence. Graph-ΔP ranking and overlapping en-echelon step-overs remain refuted as holdout-improvement signals. Details: `knowledge/11_h27_5b_geologist_review_class.md`, `evidence/structural_relay_classes.json`, `docs/topology.html`.
3. **Current untried screen:** four candidates remain in `knowledge/07_untried_hypotheses.md` and `registry/next_hypotheses.json` (H27-16, H28-3, H28-4, H28-5). H27-10 is in the tested-results record, not the untried list. No weekly-slot TIFF, note, manifest or submission artifact was generated or changed for H27-10; H27-5b is a review-only class, not a weekly submission.
4. **External sources:** NBMG layer metadata, all four fetched chunks of the OSTI-hosted Faulds & Hinz paper, and the Berkowitz publisher abstract were fetched/rechecked; status and links are in `registry/sources.json`. GDR #1391's listing and sibling-runner hash pins are recorded, but raw package bytes were not fetched or SHA-256 verified in this checkout. The two current fetch-workflow runs failed before any job; the cause is unknown and no availability inference is made.
5. **No DrivenData access or score:** no competition site was accessed, no upload was performed, and no live score was observed. GitHub PR/merge status is tracked separately in `evidence/review_passes.md`. Existing weekly files and the separate H28-1 research candidate remain unchanged. Any live score still requires a human owner's authorized submission and exact returned value.

## Prioritised next steps (carry-forward after Session 5)

1. **Resolve the GDR fetch-workflow failure and obtain/verify the three H27-16 packages.** Runs through branch head a58e74d (37099986237, 37100053264, 37100608786, 37100751573, 37100935082, and 37101134684) had zero jobs and no logs; their cause is unknown. Use an authorized Actions runner or an official package source, record the actual result, and verify each raw file against its SHA-256 pin before use. The prior sibling-runner record is not a local download; do not infer source unavailability from the empty runs.
2. **Before any new feature code, retain the four-hypothesis screen and choose one candidate only after reviewing data readiness and expected value.** Preregister the exact transform, paired controls, gates and unused seeds; do not reuse seeds 150–159 as H27-10 confirmation or tune its failed variant.
3. **Do not spend a weekly slot on a candidate until it beats the current holdout best under its frozen gate.** Even a catalogue-internal pass does not prove transfer to organizer labels. Request a human score only through the owner; the agent must never access or upload to DrivenData.
4. **Use the H27-5b files for geologist review if an expert is available.** Record any manual map interpretation with provenance; do not promote a link from graph importance, a setting hint, or the Tier-2 enrichment alone.
5. **Keep the existing limitations visible:** no hidden-label or live-score evidence; NBMG FIDs are records in one compilation; compatibility can pass with missing kinematic fields; geometry cues are not field verification; the portal validator's historical error cause remains unknown; raster-dependent CI requires the restored local cache.


---

## Session 11 addendum — limitations and required access (2026-10-03)

1. **H35-1 is refuted, and the refutation has a mechanism, but its scope is bounded.** The
   hydrothermal-discharge conjunction failed 3 of 4 frozen criteria on seeds 230–234 and lost to its own
   matched-count random control (`0.013195` vs `0.023781` credit/dot). Because LOSFO truth is *mapped*
   fault geometry, the arm's stronger claim — that a concealed, unmapped permeable structure is marked
   by a spring — remains **untested, not refuted**. What is established is that thermal dots cannot
   even clear the *upper bound*, which is enough to close the arm as constructed.
2. **The promotion of `8acb75e1f2cc` is a decision under uncertainty, not a measurement.** It replicated
   its seeds-180–189 gain almost exactly on fresh seeds 235–239 (`+0.001766` → `+0.001761`, `5/5` seeds,
   `4/4` folds) and again beat the anti-selective control (`0.000490`), which is why it is now the
   one-click file. But five seeds cannot resolve a `+0.0005` gap, and the holdout remains a *catalogue*
   proxy: `registry/irregularities.json` carries `proxy-blind-to-far-field` at **high** severity for
   exactly this reason.
3. **The only external sources verified byte-for-byte this session were already in hand.** The GDR #1391
   well/spring table was used because its bytes and hash pin were already restored; it was independently
   re-registered onto the competition grid (max `1 px` residual) before use. No new external data was
   fetched. `sciencebase.gov`, `prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com` and every other non-GitHub host still return
   HTTP `000` from the agent sandbox, so `H33-3`/`H35-2` (heat flow) and `H33-4`/`H35-3` (1 m DEMs)
   remain **GitHub-Actions-only**, which is an access requirement on the owner, not something the agent
   can grant itself. Official competition pages were read through the separate page-fetch service, which
   is *not* the sandbox network; that is why the source ledger quotes them rather than paraphrasing.
4. **No submission was made and no score was observed.** Three submissions per week are available
   (Official Rules §3.2) and none was used by this session. Every file remains `UNSCORED`. A score still
   requires the human owner to download a file, paste the registered note, upload it, and return the
   exact value.
5. **Data hygiene to respect on reuse.** `data/gdr_wellspring_in_footprint.csv` spells `Hot` two ways
   (`Hot` and `Hot ` with a trailing space) and carries a catalogue-derived `dist_known_fault_px`
   column; the volcanic-vent table stores the *string* `'nan'` in text columns. `src/gems27/thermal.py`
   uses an explicit allow-list and never reads the derived column, and `tests/test_thermal.py` asserts
   it. Any future reuse must do the same or the result is self-fulfilling.
6. **CI is green but does not exercise raster-dependent tests.** `tests/conftest.py` skips them when the
   restored cache is absent, so a green CI badge is **not** evidence the raster checks ran; they must be
   re-run locally before any release. Current local state: `190 passed, 2 skipped`, and
   `scripts/verify_downloads.py` `179/179` checks with `0` failures.
